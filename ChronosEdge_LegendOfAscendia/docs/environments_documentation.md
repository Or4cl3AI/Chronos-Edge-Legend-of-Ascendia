# Environments Documentation

## Overview

The `environments.py` file contains the `Environment` class which is used to create and manage the different environments in the game "Chronos Edge: Legend of Ascendia". This includes the breathtaking vistas of ancient ruins to the towering spires of futuristic cities.

## Dependencies

This file uses the `UnrealEngine5` for rendering the environments and the `HavokPhysics` for managing the physics in the environments.

## Environment Class

The `Environment` class has the following attributes:

- `name`: A string that represents the name of the environment.
- `description`: A string that describes the environment.
- `unreal_engine`: An instance of the `UnrealEngine5` class.
- `havok_physics`: An instance of the `HavokPhysics` class.

The `Environment` class has the following methods:

- `render()`: This method uses the `UnrealEngine5` instance to render the environment.
- `apply_physics()`: This method uses the `HavokPhysics` instance to apply physics to the environment.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `Environment` class:

```python
from game_engine import UnrealEngine5
from physics import HavokPhysics
from environments import Environment

# Initialize the game engine and physics engine
unreal_engine = UnrealEngine5()
havok_physics = HavokPhysics()

# Create an environment
environment = Environment("Ancient Ruins", "A breathtaking vista of ancient ruins.", unreal_engine, havok_physics)

# Render the environment
environment.render()

# Apply physics to the environment
environment.apply_physics()
```

This will create an environment named "Ancient Ruins", render it using the Unreal Engine 5, and apply physics to it using the Havok Physics engine.
