## HavokPhysics Engine

The HavokPhysics engine is a state-of-the-art physics engine that powers the dynamic and immersive world of "Chronos Edge: Legend of Ascendia". It is responsible for simulating realistic physics interactions in the game, including character movements, weapon strikes, and environmental interactions.

### Key Features

1. **Gravity Defying Movements**: The HavokPhysics engine allows for acrobatic combat maneuvers and awe-inspiring stunts that defy the laws of gravity. This is achieved through advanced physics simulations that take into account factors such as momentum, force, and friction.

2. **Realistic Weapon Strikes**: The physics engine also simulates the impact of weapon strikes, taking into account the type of weapon, the force of the strike, and the properties of the target.

3. **Environmental Interactions**: The HavokPhysics engine simulates realistic interactions with the game environment. This includes the destruction of objects, the movement of debris, and the effects of different terrains on character movement.

### Usage

The HavokPhysics engine is used in several files in the "Chronos Edge: Legend of Ascendia" codebase:

- `physics.py`: This file contains the core implementation of the HavokPhysics engine. It includes functions for simulating physics interactions and updating the game state based on these interactions.

- `character.py`: The physics engine is used in this file to simulate character movements and actions.

- `weapons.py`: The physics engine is used in this file to simulate the impact of weapon strikes.

- `environments.py`: The physics engine is used in this file to simulate interactions with the game environment.

- `enemies.py`: The physics engine is used in this file to simulate the movements and actions of enemy characters.

### Functions

The HavokPhysics engine provides several key functions that are used throughout the "Chronos Edge: Legend of Ascendia" codebase:

- `simulateGravity()`: This function simulates the effects of gravity on characters and objects in the game.

- `simulateImpact()`: This function simulates the impact of a weapon strike or other forceful action.

- `simulateEnvironmentInteraction()`: This function simulates interactions with the game environment, such as the destruction of objects or the effects of different terrains on character movement.
