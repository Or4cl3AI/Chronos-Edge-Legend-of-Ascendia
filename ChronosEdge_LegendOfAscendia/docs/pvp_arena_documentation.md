- `player1`: An instance of the `PlayerID` data schema, representing the first player.
- `player2`: An instance of the `PlayerID` data schema, representing the second player.

The function checks if both players are available and if the arena can accommodate a new match. If these conditions are met, the function initiates the PvP match.
